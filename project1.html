		<h1>Project One</h1>
		<h2>Fall 2015<h2>
		<h3> <center>A website by Ayana Owens</center></h3>
		<br>
		<h4>Research</h4>
		<p>Through peer interviews the most common thing people want to see are images on a gallery site. Many people have not visited the Towson Galleries webpage and after doing so believed it to be bland and not very interseting. Also it was thought to be very unatrractive.  It was found to be easy to naviagte and gain necessary information to visit the galleries. </p>
		<p>Design Criteria:<br>
			Images<br>
			Simple navigation<br>
			Common information first - location, dates... etc.<br>
			Consistant design</p>

		<p> Of the researched webpages, the BMA had the most interesting design combined with images, easy navigation, consistant design and accesiable information. Towson fell further down on the list due to and unnattractive design and lack of images reguarding the actual galleries. Furthest down on the list was Johns Hopkins due to their overly basic design that does not really give any information about the galleries and does not attract many users to stay on the site. MICA's gallery webpage ranks at two because of its images used to keep you engaed, its simplified design as to not clutter the page and easily accessed information. </p>
